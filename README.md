# ProgressMe
This is an app for ambitious people. It enhances their life by allowing them to record their goals and view how far the goals are reached in percentages, i.e. reading a book can be tracked by counting how many pages were read divided by total number of readable pages.

Those goals are can be shared publicly in the network you are in. Choose which objective can be visible to others with the privacy settings per objective.

The backbone of this application is Flutter, which means that most of ProgressMe will be written in Dart.
